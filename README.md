# Bank Loan Report Project

## Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to monitor and assess our bank's lending activities and performance through a comprehensive Bank Loan Report. This report will provide insights into key loan-related metrics and their changes over time, helping us make data-driven decisions, track our loan portfolio's health, and identify trends to inform our lending strategies.

## Dashboards Overview

### Dashboard 1: Summary
This dashboard provides a high-level overview of our bank's lending metrics, including:

- **Total Loan Applications**: Calculate the total number of loan applications received during a specified period, including Month-to-Date (MTD) Loan Applications and Month-over-Month (MoM) changes.
- **Total Funded Amount**: Track the total amount of funds disbursed as loans, with MTD and MoM analysis.
- **Total Amount Received**: Monitor the total amount received from borrowers, with MTD and MoM analysis.
- **Average Interest Rate**: Calculate the average interest rate across all loans, with MTD and MoM variations.
- **Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)**: Evaluate the average DTI for borrowers, with MTD and MoM fluctuations.

### Good Loan vs. Bad Loan KPIs
Distinguish between 'Good Loans' and 'Bad Loans' based on specific loan status criteria:

- **Good Loans**:
  - Good Loan Application Percentage
  - Good Loan Applications
  - Good Loan Funded Amount
  - Good Loan Total Received Amount

- **Bad Loans**:
  - Bad Loan Application Percentage
  - Bad Loan Applications
  - Bad Loan Funded Amount
  - Bad Loan Total Received Amount
